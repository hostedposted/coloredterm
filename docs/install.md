# Installation

Installing coloredterm is very simple.

All you need to have to install it is pip and python 2.7 or higher.

If you do not have pip installed you can use this to install it:

```bash
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python get-pip.py
```

Once you have pip installed simply use:
```bash
python -m pip install coloredterm
```

With that installed you can start using the module!
